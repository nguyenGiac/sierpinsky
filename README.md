sierpinsky's sieve. sweet simple algorithm.

i read about this algorithm in *FractalVision: Put Fractals to Work For You*. it sounded really simple. too simple to be real. but! it works!

this is all it is (you can do it with pen and paper):
*pick three points (make a triangle).
*choose a random point within those three.
*randomly pick one of the three original points.
*find the point exactly halfway between them,
*draw a dot,
*randomly select one of the three original,
*find the point between them,
*draw a dot,
*randomly select one of three...
*repeat..
